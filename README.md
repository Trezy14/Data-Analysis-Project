# SQL Data Analysis Project on Unicorn company database

PROJECT: 
You have been asked to support an investment firm by analyzing trends in high-growth companies. They are interested in understanding which 
industries are producing the highest valuations and the rate at which new high-value companies are emerging. 
Providing them with this information gives them a competitive insight as to industry trends and how they should structure their portfolio looking forward.


SOLUTION;
I queried the Uicorns database and 1 was able to identify the three best-performing industries based on the number of new unicorns created over the last three years (2019, 2020, and 2021) combined.

From there, I wrote a query to return the industry, the year, the number of companies in these industries that became unicorns each year in 2019, 2020, and 2021, along with the average valuation per industry per year, converted to billions of dollars and rounded to two decimal places.
As the firm is interested in trends for the top-performing industries, I ordered my result by industry and year in descending order.
